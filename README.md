# Public_Antivirus

!!!This Project is still under construction!!!
Please contribute some code if possible. It will help a lot.



I am a beginner at cybersecurity and malware analysis.
I have created this repo with a vision to protect millions of android users who are often victims of malware and other type of cyber-security attacks.
I believe an open-source antivirus would be effective enough to defeat almost any cyber security attacks.
I would personally be grateful if you contribute some effective code (or even comment,report issue, etc) to this open project.

Thank You
